# John Lewis Partnership UI Dev Test


### Instructions
First, download the repository and run `yarn install` to install the app.\
Then you can use `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.\
Or `yarn test` to run the tests and view coverage.

You can then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

### Assumptions
For the purposes of this test, I am assuming that:

 * The stack I should be using includes JS(ES6+), React and SASS as per the job specification.
 * Creating the app from scratch is preferred to using Create React App or similar. 
 * The app should work in a variety of browsers.
 * API calls should be mocked for faster testing and to avoid any potential issues with the backend. 
 * If a product does not have a title or a price, it should not be shown.

 ### Notes

 * Axios has been used for API requests in order to provide backwards compatibility.
